In this repository you can find the code we used to run the montecarlo simulation for the Ocean Carriers case.
All the values assumed and assigned to the variables are explicitly written (i.e. number of iterations, standard deviations assumed etc.)
Any number hard-coded comes from calculations performed in excel, which we did not make again to save computational power and make the code run faster.
